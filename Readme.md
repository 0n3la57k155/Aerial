## Installation

With changes in Catalina and Big Sur, a screen saver can no longer update itself, so I've made a separate companion app that can update Aerial in the background or when you manually choose to update it. This is the preferred way to install and keep Aerial up to date!

**Installation instructions:**
- Download AerialInstaller.dmg [from here](https://github.com/glouel/AerialCompanion/releases/latest) 
- Open the .dmg and follow the instructions (for more information, [click here](https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/blob/master/Documentation/FAQs.md#how-do-i-install-aerial)
- This will install both the companion app and the screen saver (or update you to the current version if you already have it installed)

Need more information on install, setup, or uninstall? Or want to install via homebrew or manually? Check our extended [instructions here](Documentation/Installation.md). 

## What's New in Aerial 2.0.0+ (Aug 19, 2020)?

- 20 new videos! Starting with version 2.0, Aerial includes new videos kindly shared by Joshua Michaels & Hal Bergman:

If you enjoy those videos, please consider supporting them by checking the video packs they have [created especially for Aerial on their website](https://www.jetsoncreative.com/aerial).

- A whole new UI, that feels just right at home on macOS Big Sur. It still looks great on other macOS versions, don't worry! It includes large live previews of videos, and new easy ways to found the videos you like, and don't like! It's even resizable!

- New cache options! You can *finally* set a cache size limit, so Aerial will not fill up your disk. Aerial can also periodically replace videos in your cache, say after a week, so things stay fresh. 

You can still opt to manually download your videos, or simply grab them all. All up to you. If you allow automatic downloads, you can even specify a list of trusted WiFi networks!

- A new "On rotation" feature, so you can quickly switch from watching space videos, to only sunset videos:

- You can also favorite and hide videos now, based on your preferences. 

- There are many other new options, including vibrance control if you want to make your non HDR videos pop a bit more, sunset and sunrise video at appropriate time, and more!

You can find more about [version changes here](Documentation/ChangeLog.md).

## Multilingual Support

Aerial features overlay descriptions of the main geographical features displayed in the videos.

![Community Strings example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4295/52958947-75bd6180-3395-11e9-947f-3c77d9f41928.jpg)
