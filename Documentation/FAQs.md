## My Cache is too large/small

Aerial can cache videos in two different ways:
- *Manually* 
- *Automatically*

When caching is set to **manual** you will need to download and manage your cache entirely manually. When set to **automatic**, you can set the size of your cache and Aerial will fill it with the videos you love! 

#### Manual Cache Management
1. Open Aerial in System Preferneces 
2. Click on the settings tab (gear at the top of the sidebar)
3. Click on `Cache` on the sidebar
4. Uncheck 'Automatically download videos`

5. Now download any videos you want to cache manually. 
6. Note that this may take up a significant amount of disk space. To delete or prune your cache, click the `Show in Finder` button and delete any videos you no longer want. 

#### Automatic Cache Management
1. Open Aerial in System Preferneces 
2. Click on the settings tab (gear at the top of the sidebar)
3. Click on `Cache` on the sidebar
4. Check 'Automatically download videos` 
<img width="400" alt="Automatic management" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18543749/90852209-e35c9c00-e344-11ea-9505-481789a581d7.png">
5. Set your **cache limit size** -- This is the MAXIMUM size you want your cache. If you don't want to set a maximum, move the slider all the way to the right.
6. Select how often you want to rotate your videos in your cache

7. **NOTE:** if you have fewer videos selected than your cache size limit, videos will not rotate. If your cache is larger than your limit, then over the course of the selected time period your cache will be automatically pruned until you are under your cache limit and then videos will periodically rotate)
