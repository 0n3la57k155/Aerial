# More Videos

On top of the classic Apple TV screen savers, Aerial can display videos from other sources :
- Local sources : Those are, quite simply, videos that are on your machine. Rule of thumb is, if QuickTime can play it, Aerial can. There are a few complexity surrounding Catalina and Big Sur, because of sandboxing changes and security improvements in macOS. As a result, you cannot add videos from the "likely" location you'd want to use (Downloads, Desktop, Documents) and it's highly recommended to use a "safe location" like `/Users/Shared/`. Local sources are not supported in the current 2.0.0 build but will be back soon, check [those instructions, for use in version 1.9.2](https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/blob/master/Documentation/CustomVideos.md).

- Community videos : Those are videos that have been donated to the project by artists so they can be enjoyed in Aerial by everyone. This is a curated list, as those videos will appear from everyone. If you are an artist or a tourism association that want to share videos, check out this page here for more information : https://github.com/glouel/AerialCommunity

- 3rd party online sources : If you don't want to share the videos through the community, you can still make your own online source that can be imported by Aerial users. Check out [the instructions here](https://github.com/glouel/AerialCommunity/blob/master/CreatingASource.md) on how to create your own video sources. You can drop us a line there too so we feature your source here, if you wish.
